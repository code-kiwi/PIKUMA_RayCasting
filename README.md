# Raycasting experiments

This repository contains raycasting experiments developed while following the
Pikuma raycasting course.

## Context
The goal of this repository was to understand the core principles behind raycasting
and early 3D rendering techniques, as a preparation step for the Cub3D project
from the École 42 curriculum.

## Content
- A basic raycaster implemented in JavaScript for the browser
- An early and partial raycasting implementation in C

## Purpose
This work served as a learning and experimentation ground to explore:
- Raycasting fundamentals
- Camera projection concepts
- Grid-based world representation
- Performance considerations

## Technical stack
- JavaScript (browser)
- C
- Math / raycasting concepts

## Notes
This repository is not intended to be a complete or polished project.
It focuses on experimentation and learning.
